# LLM Installer v2: Technical Specification

## Project Overview

### Problem
Installing and running LLM models from HuggingFace requires:
- Manual installation of numerous dependencies
- Writing code to load and run the model
- Understanding specifics of each model
- Configuring parameters for user hardware
- Organizing files and environments

### Solution
LLM Installer v2 is a set of scripts that automates the entire process from compatibility checking to model launch.

### Key Features
1. **Compatibility Check** - analyze model WITHOUT downloading weights
2. **Automatic Installation** - download model and all dependencies
3. **Environment Isolation** - each model in its own folder with its own venv
4. **Universal Scripts** - copy ready-to-use scripts that work with any model
5. **Simple Launch** - one command to start the model
